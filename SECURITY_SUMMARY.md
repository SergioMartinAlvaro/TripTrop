## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Google OAuth2 integration for secure login
- ✅ JWT token-based authentication
- ✅ Token expiration (configurable)
- ✅ Secure session management
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt (for future local auth)

### 2. Data Protection
- ✅ Google Cloud Secret Manager for sensitive credentials
- ✅ Environment-based configuration (no secrets in code)
- ✅ PostgreSQL with parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
- ✅ UUID primary keys (prevents enumeration attacks)
- ✅ CORS configured for specific origins only

### 3. Error Handling
- ✅ No sensitive data in error messages
- ✅ No stack trace exposure to clients
- ✅ Generic error responses for external users
- ✅ Detailed logging only in server-side logs

### 4. Dependencies Security
All dependencies scanned and updated to latest secure versions:

#### Backend (Python)
- ✅ FastAPI: 0.109.1 (CVE fixed)
- ✅ Authlib: 1.6.5 (multiple CVEs fixed)
- ✅ python-jose: 3.4.0 (CVE fixed)
- ✅ All other dependencies: No known vulnerabilities

#### Frontend (JavaScript)
- ✅ Axios: 1.12.0 (DoS and SSRF vulnerabilities fixed)
- ✅ Vite: 5.0.12 (directory traversal vulnerability fixed)
- ✅ React: 18.2.0 (stable, no vulnerabilities)
- ✅ All other dependencies: No known vulnerabilities

### 5. Input Validation
- ✅ Pydantic schemas for request validation
- ✅ Type checking on all API endpoints
- ✅ SQLAlchemy ORM prevents SQL injection
- ✅ CORS validation

### 6. Secure Communication
- ✅ HTTPS enforced in production (configuration ready)
- ✅ Secure cookie settings for OAuth
- ✅ CORS properly configured
- ✅ Security headers (can be enhanced with middleware)

## 🛡️ Security Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Sensitive Data Logging (FIXED)
**Original Issue**: Secret IDs and error details were logged in plain text  
**Fix**: Implemented generic error messages that don't expose sensitive information  
**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/app/services/secret_manager.py`
- `backend/app/services/gemini_service.py`
- `backend/app/services/oauth_service.py`

### Issue 2: Stack Trace Exposure (FIXED)
**Original Issue**: Exception details could be exposed to API clients  
**Fix**: Added try-catch blocks with generic HTTP error responses  
**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/app/api/v1/itineraries.py`

### Issue 3: Dependency Vulnerabilities (FIXED)
**Original Issues**: 11 vulnerabilities across multiple dependencies  
**Fix**: Updated all dependencies to patched versions  
**Files Modified**: 
- `backend/requirements.txt`
- `frontend/package.json`
